# JavaCC Compiler Project

This project is a simple compiler built using JavaCC (Java Compiler Compiler). It includes a grammar file (`JavaGrammar.jj`) and a test file (`Simple.java`) to demonstrate the functionality of the compiler.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following files:
- **`JavaGrammar.jj`**: The JavaCC grammar file that defines the syntax and rules for the compiler.
- **`Simple.java`**: A simple Java file used to test the compiler.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use JavaCC to create a compiler and test it with a sample Java file.

## Project Timeline

- **19/12/2024**: Project created. Initial commit includes the following files:
  - `JavaGrammar.jj`: The main grammar file for the compiler.
  - `Simple.java`: A test file to validate the compiler's functionality.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required to compile and run Java programs.
- **JavaCC**: A tool for generating parsers and lexical analyzers in Java.

---

## Downloading and Installing JavaCC

To download and install JavaCC, follow these steps:

1. **Download JavaCC**:
   - Visit the official JavaCC website to download the latest version: [JavaCC Download](https://javacc.github.io/javacc/).

2. **Install JavaCC**:
   - Once you have downloaded the files, navigate to the download directory and unzip the source file. This will create a JavaCC installation directory.
   - Move the binary file `javacc-7.0.14.jar` (or the version you downloaded) from the download directory to a new `target/` directory under the installation directory. Rename it to `javacc.jar`.
   - Add the `scripts/` directory in the JavaCC installation directory to your `PATH`. The JavaCC, JJTree, and JJDoc invocation scripts/executables reside in this directory.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   - Clone this repository or download the project files (`JavaGrammar.jj` and `Simple.java`) to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the project files are located.

## Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Generate the Parser**:
   - Run the following command to generate the parser using JavaCC:
     ```bash
     javacc JavaGrammar.jj
     ```

2. **Compile the Generated Java Files**:
   - Compile all the generated Java files using the following command:
     ```bash
     javac *.java
     ```

3. **Test the Compiler**:
   - Test the compiler by running the following command:
     ```bash
     java JavaGrammar Simple.java
     ```

## Testing the Compiler

The `Simple.java` file is provided as a test case for the compiler. You can modify this file or create new Java files to test the functionality of the compiler.
